# Inventory Mangement Mobile App

## Project Description

This mobile app is aninventory management software that provides easy tracking of assets and their repair history, repair request and response between technicians and users, and a social forum for the employees.

A user may submit a repair request to a specific asset, which is then relayed to the request queue to be processed by a technician. An available technician will then take the request off the queue, and once it is handled, the repair detail will be logged. A technician or admin may add additional assets into the system or edit them. Lastly, the application provides basic statistical analysis on the inventory.
